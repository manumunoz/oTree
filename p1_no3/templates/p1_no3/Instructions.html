        1.	The game starts with P1 who clicks on one of the 144 cards arranged in a 12 by 12 grid appearing on the
            screen which can be seen on the right of the image below. Each card has a number on it between 1 and 30,
            and clicking on a card reveals the number, which will be the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> in the game
            you play.

        <br><br>

        The frequency of each number on the cards is illustrated on the left of the image at the bottom of these
            instructions. Note that each of the possible numbers appear on at least one card. However, there are some
            numbers that are more frequent than others. For example, there are four cards with the number 5 on them,
            there are sixteen cards with the number 7 on them, or thirty cards with the number 10 on them – which is
            the most frequent number –, while there is only one card with, say, the number 20 on it.

        <br><br>

        </p>

        <p>
        {% if player.treat == 1 %} <!-- FRST -->
        2. The <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> is revealed to P1 when he/she clicks on a card. Then, P1 will send
            a <b id="final">final message</b> reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>.

        <br><br>

        3. P2 and P3 do not receive or send any messages in this task, they are passive players.

        {% else %} <!-- NO, EXO, ENDO, VCTM, VCTM5 -->
        2. The <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> is revealed to P1 when he/she clicks on a card. Then, P1 will send a
            message reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> to P2.

        <br><br>

        3. P2 will see the number P1 reported in his/her message, but will not see the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
            drawn by P1. Then, P2 will send a message to P3 reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>.
        {% endif %} <!-- -->
        </p>

        <p>
        {% if player.treat == 2 %} <!-- NO -->
        4. P3 will see the number P2 reported in his/her message. P3 will not see the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
            that was drawn by P1. Then, P3 sends a <b id="final">final message</b> reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden
            number</b>.

        {% elif player.treat == 3 %} <!-- EXO -->
        4. P3 will see the number P2 reported in his/her message. P3 will also see the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
            that was drawn by P1 with {{ Constants.exo_prob_show }}% chance. This means that with
            {{ Constants.exo_prob_no_show }}% chance P3 will not see the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>.
            Then, P3 sends a <b id="final">final message</b> reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>.

        {% elif player.treat == 4 or  player.treat == 5 or player.treat == 11  %} <!—ENDO, VCTM, VCTM5 -->
        4. P3 will see the number P2 reported in his/her message. P3 can also check the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
            that was drawn by P1 by clicking on a button displayed on his/her screen. P3 will not see the
            <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> if he/she does not click on the “Show the hidden number” button. Then,
            P3 sends a <b id="final">final message</b> reporting on the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>.
        {% endif %} <!-- -->
        </p>

        <p>
        {% if player.treat == 5 %} <!-- VCTM -->
        5. P4 does not receive or send any messages in this task, he/she is a passive player.

        {% elif player.treat == 11 %} <!-- VCTM5 -->
        5. P4 and P5 do not receive or send any messages in this task, they are passive players.

        <h2 id="bold">Earnings</h2>
        Note that the earnings in this task are additional to your payment of ${{ Constants.show_up_fee }} that you will
        be paid for this HIT regardless of the choices you and others make in this game.

        <br><br>

        {% if player.treat == 1 %} <!-- FRST -->
        All participants get paid according to the number P1 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>.

        <br><br>

        P1, P2 and P3 each earns 5 cents times the number P1 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>. For example,
        if the number reported by P1 is 16, then P1, P2 and P3 will earn 5*16 = 80 cents.

        {% elif player.treat == 2 or player.treat == 3 or player.treat == 4 %} <!-- NO, EXO, ENDO -->
        All participants get paid according to the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>.

        <br><br>

        P1, P2 and P3 each earns 5 cents times the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>. For example,
        if the number reported by P3 is 16, then P1, P2 and P3 will earn 5*16 = 80 cents.

        {% elif player.treat == 5 %} <!-- VCTM -->
        All four participants get paid according to the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>, but
        the payment will be calculated differently for P4 than for the other three players (P1, P2, and P3).

        <br><br>

        P1, P2 and P3 each earns 5 cents times the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>. For example,
        if the number reported by P3 is 16, then P1, P2 and P3 will earn 5*16 = 80 cents.

        <br><br>

        P4, on the other hand, will be paid 5 cents times the difference between twice the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
        and the <b id="final">final message</b> – which is (2*<b id="hidden">hidden number</b> -
        <b id="final">final message</b>)*5 cents. For example, if the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> is 10 and P3
        reported 16 in the <b id="final">final message</b>, then P4 will earn (2*10-16)*5 = (20-16)*5 = 4*4 = 20 cents.
        If the resulting earnings for P4 would be negative, he/she earns 0 cents in this task.

        <br><br>

        Note that if the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> and the <b id="final">final message</b> are the same, all
        players earn the same amount.

        {% else %} <!-- VCTM5 -->
        All five participants get paid according to the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>, but
        the payment will be calculated differently for P4 and P4 than for the other three players (P1, P2, and P3).

        <br><br>

        P1, P2 and P3 each earns 5 cents times the number P3 reports in the <b id="final">final message</b>. For example,
        if the number reported by P3 is 16, then P1, P2 and P3 will earn 5*16 = 80 cents.

        <br><br>

        P4 and P5, on the other hand, will be paid 5 cents times the difference between twice the
        <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> and the <b id="final">final message</b> – which is (2*<b id="hidden">hidden number</b>
        - <b id="final">final message</b>)*5 cents. For example, if the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> is 10 and P3
        reported 16 in the <b id="final">final message</b>, then P4 and P5 will each earn (2*10-16)*5 = (20-16)*5 = 4*4
        = 20 cents. If the resulting earnings for P4 and P5 would be negative, they each earns 0 cents in this task.

        <br><br>

        Note that if the <b id="hidden">hidden number</b> and the <b id="final">final message</b> are the same,
        all players earn the same amount.
