            In this screen you will see the instructions for the decisions you make in each round in Part 1.
            The instructions will use as illustrations the Figures 1, 2 and 3 below as well as the example images on the
            right hand side.

            <h5>Groups, Appearances & Numbers</h5>
            In this experiment you will participate with 6 players more. Each player is randomly assigned to a group &#9679
          or &#9650, and will also have an appearance &#9711 (if group &#9679) or &#9651 (if group
          &#9650) and a number from 1 to 7. You will see the group, appearance and number of each player in the display
          (see Figure 1 ), and you will always see yours also on the header of each screen (see example).

          <br><br>
            A player’s group and appearance will not change during Part 1 while the number and position in the display
          will be randomly changed in each round.

            <h5>Stage 1: Relations</h5>
          In the <b>Relations stage</b> you will propose a relation to those players you want to participate with in Stage 2,
          by clicking on the checkbox next to a player’s label (see example). If you propose a relation to a player who
          <b>also</b> proposes to you, there is an <b>active relation</b> between the two of you. In Stage 2 you will
          <b>only participate</b> with the players with whom you have an active relation.

          <br><br>
            You will see your relations in the display (see Figure 2). There is a light arrow leaving from you for each
          relation you proposed, and a dark arrow heading towards you for each relation proposed to you. If both arrows
          are present you have an active relation with that other player. If only one of you proposes a relation but the
          other does not, there is no active relation between the two of you. <i>Your relations are thicker and those of
          others are thinner.</i>

            <h5>Stage 2: Options</h5>
          In the <b>Option stage</b> you will pick one of two options: <b style="color:#E91E63">Up</b> or
          <b style="color:#009688">Down</b> (see example). You will get points for each
          of your active relations picking <b>the same option as you</b>. You will <b>not</b> get any points for an
          active relation picking a different option than you, nor from a player picking the same option as you, if he
          <b>is not</b> an active connection.
          <br><br>
            The option picked by each player is illustrated by the color of his appearance (see Figure 3).
          <br><br>
            In the next screen we will show you how many points can you earn.
