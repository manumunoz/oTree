                    <p>
                    In Part 2 you will interact with {{ Constants.others }} other players. At the beginning of every round
                    (in Stage 1) each of you will be choose a group: &#9679 or &#9650. You will earn points according to
                    the group you choose in Stage 1 and not according to the group you were assigned to (in case they are
                    different). You will have an appearance (&#9711 or &#9651) and a label (1 to 7). You can change your
                    group and appearance in each round while your label will be changed by the computer. There are 4
                    stages in each round.

                    determine your payment. We will convert the points into Euros using the following exchange rate:Â 
                    <b>{{ Constants.exchange }} points = 1 Euro</b>. You will receive your earnings in cash.
